Sample problem
You buy a 2010 F-150 4WD Super Cab 145' XLT in the year 2010 for $32,940.00 and in 2015 you sell it for 
$24,145.00, six years later in 2021 that person sells it for $8,637.00. 
In what year will the truck be worth approximately $0. 
According the program the truck will be worth $2,262.85 in 2023 and after that it will be worthless.
